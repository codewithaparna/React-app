                <h2>YOGA</h2>

                <p>Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle Science which focuses on bringing harmony between 
                    mind and body. It is an art and science for healthy living. The word "Yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj meaning 
                    "to join", "to yoke" or "to unite".

                    According to Yogic scriptures, the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with universal 
                    consciousness. According to modern scientists, everything in the universe is just a manifestation of the same quantum 
                    firmament. One who experiences this oneness of existence is said to be "in Yoga" and is termed as a yogi who has attained
                    a state of freedom, referred to as Mukti, nirvāna, kaivalya or moksha.
                    
                    "Yoga" also refers to an inner science comprising of a variety of methods through which human beings can achieve union 
                    between the body and mind to attain self-realisation. The aim of Yoga practice (sādhana) is to overcome all kinds of 
                    sufferings that lead to a sense of freedom in every walk of life with holistic health, happiness and harmony.
